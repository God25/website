<H3>About</H3>
My name is Wesley "Honey Boy" David Payton. I am a self taught artist who's passion is drawing portraits. Also I love to make abstract art work while using people. My medium is graphite and charcoal. My whole philosophy is God having a human experiance. So my artist name is God 25. My goal is to use art work to teach people awareness and observation so thier consciousness be more God like.
